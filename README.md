# Unique Color Image Generator

This project is a web-based application that generates an image where each color is represented exactly once. Each color is defined by combining RGB components (Red, Green, Blue) each ranging from 8 to 256 in increments of 8, resulting in 32,768 unique colors. Originally developed as a Flask app, it has been converted to a pure HTML/CSS/JavaScript project.
